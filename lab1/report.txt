# Results ######

Our egg timer applications has two threads and our main process.
The main process creates the reader thread and blinker thread.
The main process will then go into a loop where it constantly checks the user button.
If the user button is pressed then the LEDs will turn off if they are on.

Thread 1 (reader)
The reader thread will wait for input.
When 's' is pressed the thread will begin to ask the user for a time to set.
The time will then be placed in a static global variable egg_timer where the blinker thread will use it.

Thread 2 (blinker)
The blinker thread will blink the North RED LED when the egg_timer has a value.
The egg_timer will not have a value until it is set the first time.

# Difficulties #

Getting the threads to communicate in an efficient way was troubling.
We made static variables that could be set by each thread.
